# Riverside

Riverside is a waterfront event, showcasing music, food and crafts made in the Greater Toronto Area.

## Design Choices

- Green and blue were used to elicit a foresty/water theme. The event is outdoors
- Since event is outdoors, I wanted the website to reflect a more unrestricted feeling, so there are less borders used to separate sections from each other
- Participating section has a white background so it stands out against the green. It's also a good way to break up all of the green on the page without deviating from the base style too much.
- Dark blue stands out without being overwhelmingly bright
